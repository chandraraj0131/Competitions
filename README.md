## 10 Days of Code GLUG_NITDGP
This was the first Machine Learning competition I took part in, where we had to build a stock price prediction model using standard algorithms, and I'm so happy to say that my journey from "Top performer of the day" to "Best performer for Ten Days Of Code, 2020" had been absolutely amazing. From learning to about the workings of the stock market to brushing up the final presentation for the mentors, I learned a lot. Thanks to my mentors for guiding me along the way. Execution of a stock price predicting model using ML algorithms. I used Linear regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor as standard ML algorithms and later an LSTMs based RNN.
While this was quite a fun and insightful project, it is more important to throw light on why it is not a good idea to use these prediction models for practical purposes. This article by Lee Schmalz captures the essence of it impressively - https://towardsdatascience.com/using-neural-networks-to-predict-stock-prices-dont-be-fooled-c43a4e26ae4e (Open in incognito mode if you do not have a membership.)


## FactElytics, Drishti'21,SIOM
Worked tirelessly for the 7 days on “FactElytics” organized by Drishti, the Annual fest of SIOM Nashik.
From a total of 330 participants, 87 teams were shortlisted after a quiz round held on Dare2Compete.
Making it to the top 8 Teams, being the only individual participant, based on F1 score on a model for a banking institution’s campaigning dataset. Teams were required to submit an executive summary PPT on their approach by addressing the issues and concerns outlined in the case.
For the final round, all 8 teams were to virtually present the solution in front of esteemed judges, Balpreet Singh and Dr. Prashant Barge, where the deciding factors were case study approach, out of the box ideas, machine learning model, and approach, bringing out insights from data thoroughness and many more along with good presentation skills.
Sadly, I did not land any of the top 3 spots.
